# v1.3.2 (19 Aug 2025)
	- Added missing library `PubSubClient` as MQTT examples depend on it
	- Added new examples for Shabakah:
				> Temp/Humd Alarm System
				> Bluetooth LED Control
				> MQTT LED Subscriber
	- Updated Simple MQTT Publisher/Subscriber examples with different MQTT topics and renamed `MQTT_Reconnect` function to `MQTT_Connect` for consistency

# v1.3.1 (20 Mar 2025)
	- Updated core to match latest version of ESP32 tools and libraries (`Arduino Release v3.1.3 based on ESP-IDF v5.3`)
	- Added new examples for Shabakah:
				> Simple MQTT Publisher
				> Simple MQTT Subscriber
	- Updated `Adafruit NeoPixel` library to version 1.12.5
	- Scrapped the use of git submodules for Remal libraries and added them directly to the repository as every arch update required re-initing all submodules from scratch
	- Multiple Remal libraries were updated to latest versions:
				> `Remal_CommonUtils v1.1.0`
				> `Remal_BLE_Serial v1.0.1`
	- Shabakah Founders Edition (v3.X) is now deprecated and will no longer be updated. All new updates will be for Shabakah v4 only. Note that v4 and v3.X share the same MCU and so the examples are compatible with both boards with minor changes in the pinout
	- Updated `Shabakah_RGB_LED_SolidColor.ino` example with small bug fix due to both LEDs not turning on if there isn't a small delay between the two calls to `show()` function
	- Updated Shabakah v4 and Shabakah FE to both use `Minimal SPIFFS (1.9MB APP with OTA/190KB SPIFFS)` as their default partition scheme
	- Updated some example comments from "Remal IoT" to "Remal"

# v1.3.0 (17 Jan 2025)
	- Updated core to match latest version of ESP32 tools and libraries, a lot of tools and examples were updated and new examples added (Arduino Release v3.1.1 based on ESP-IDF v5.3.2)
	- Updated `Adafruit NeoPixel` library to version 1.12.4
	- Updated `shabakah_fe` and `shabakah_v4` `pins_arduino.h` file under `variants` folder. Added new defines for Shabakah for use if needed: `SHBK_BOARD` for all Shabakah boards and `SHBK_FE` and `SHBK_V4` for specific Shabakah variations
	
# v1.2.6 (11 Aug 2024)
	- Add new Remal library "Remal_CommonUtils" (a git submodule)
	- Updated "Remal_SHT3X" library to be git submodule
	- Updated "Remal_BLE_Serial" library to be git submodule
	- Updated text across different files to use "Remal" instead of "Remal IoT"

# v1.2.5 (12 Jan 2023)
	- Added new Shabakah v4 variant (ESP32-C3-MINI) with examples

# v1.2.4 (11 Jan 2023)
	- Latest updates now hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/remaliot/Remal_ArduinoBoards
	- Renamed Shabakah v3.X to Shabakah (Founders Edition)
	- Updated core to match latest version of ESP32 tools and libraries (v2.0.14)
	- Updated "Remal_SHT3X" library to v2.0.1

# v1.2.3 (31 Aug 2023)
	- Fixed missing "Remal_BLE_Serial" library issue
	
# v1.2.2 (13 Aug 2023)
	- Added new Remal IoT library for the SHT3X Temperature and Humidity Sensor "Remal_SHT3X" with example code
	- Updated all examples to utilize our new "Remal_SHT3X" library 
	
# v1.2.1 (29 Jul 2023)
	- Updated core to match latest version of ESP32 tools and libraries (v2.0.11)
	- Created new Remal IoT library to handle Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Serial communication "Remal_BLE_Serial"
	- Added new example for Shabakah:
				> Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Serial Communication
	- Changed folder name from "remal_iot" to "remal" to avoid an issue on Windows when building projects and the file path is too long
			
# v1.2.0 (19 Jul 2023)
	- Updated core to match latest version of ESP32 tools and libraries (v2.0.10)
	- Added new library "Adafruit_NeoPixel" with examples
	- Removed "Freenove" library
	- Updated "DemoCode" example to use "Adafruit NeoPixel" library instead of "Freenove" library and made the example more clear
	- Added new examples for Shabakah:
				> Button Press
				> RGB LED Solid Color
				> Temperature and Humidity Measurements
				> Wi-Fi AP + Temperature and Humidity Readings
	
# v1.1.1 (16 Apr 2023)
